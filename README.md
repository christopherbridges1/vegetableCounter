Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This Project imports a .txt document and counts the instances, outputting to a .dat. It was created to count the occurences for produce but could be adapted for other uses. 

What did you do particularly well?
Input validation and error handling was the highlight of this assignment in my opinion.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
To improve it, I could sort the outputs based on user preferences. Numerically, alphabetically, ascending or descending.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was finding a way to force uppercase when searching for an object. I had to dig through the provided materials to find an answer.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I believe this project really made me try to break my code, using different cases for user input.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project was made modular with a header file and different functions called by the main. This helps if I decide to change something later. I used proper spacing and comments to help readability.
